The arities of the operators are:
      [0 : -> NAT ]
      [succ : NAT -> NAT ]
      [null : -> NATLIST ]
      [cons : NAT, NATLIST -> NATLIST ]


The system has the following constructors:
     Type 'NAT': { 0, succ }
     Type 'NATLIST': { null, cons }

There are no equivalent operators.

There is no ordering yet in the precedence relation.

There are no operators with status.
